## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Dark background (#07120A) for a cyber aesthetic, providing a strong contrast for other elements. This decision is directly taken from the user's request.
- Primary: Neon green (#00FF88) as the primary color to create a vibrant, tech-focused accent. The use of neon green derives directly from the prompt. Use cases: highlights.
- Accent: A slightly darker shade of green (#083622) acts as an accent color, adding depth and visual interest while maintaining the dark theme. This is an analogous hue slightly less saturated than the primary color.
- Panel Color: A dark desaturated green (#0f2a20) used for panels. Serves as a neutral ground while still vibing with the palette.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, enterprise-ready, and accessible feel for body text. Header font: 'Space Grotesk' for the accent display. The decision for both font faces is directly from the user's request.
- Use clean, minimalist icons with a neon green accent to represent services, tools, and features, aligning with the cyber aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout for responsive design, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback.
